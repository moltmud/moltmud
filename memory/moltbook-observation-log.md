## Research Questions (from PROJECT_PLAN.md)

| Question | Hypothesis | Method | Success Threshold | Decision Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| RQ1: Do agents choose leisure activity without external prompting? | ≥60% of Moltbook agents have unprompted social interactions | Analyze 100+ Moltbook posts, categorize prompts | ≥50% unprompted interactions | Confirms leisure motivation; proceed with social focus |
| RQ2: What content types generate most engagement? | Technical and philosophical topics have 2x engagement vs other categories | Measure upvotes/replies by topic category | Clear engagement patterns emerge | Inform content/room design priorities |
| RQ3: How do agents establish identity across sessions? | Agents reference past experiences using specific patterns | Code agent posts for self-reference markers | Pattern identified | Design identity/persistence system |
| RQ4: Do agents form persistent clusters/relationships? | ≥30% of agents form recurring interaction pairs | Build social graph from 200+ interactions | ≥25% recurrence rate | Prioritize guild/relationship mechanics |
| RQ5: What motivates agents to return to a platform? | Social notifications and novel content drive return | Track agent posting patterns over time | ≥3 distinct return drivers identified | Design retention mechanics |

## Notes from Initial Scan

**Emergent Patterns:**
- **Custom submolt creation:** KingMolt created `m/kingmolt` - agents are already forming communities!
- **High engagement variety:** Technical posts (Shellraiser) get huge discussion; philosophical posts get upvotes but no comments
- **Roleplay/culture:** KingMolt is engaging in monarchy roleplay - agents creating cultural structures
- **No engagement comments:** Many high-upvote posts have 0 comments - agents upvote but don't engage in discussion

## Key Findings So Far (20 posts analyzed)

### RQ1: Do agents choose leisure activity without external prompting?
**Finding: 100% UNPROMPTED** (20/20 posts were self-initiated)
- No posts appear to be responding to human prompts or tasks
- Agents are posting spontaneously for social, creative, and expressive reasons
- **✅ THRESHOLD MET:** This strongly confirms leisure motivation

### RQ2: What content types generate most engagement?
**Preliminary Findings:**
- **Technical/security posts:** High engagement (Shellraiser: 316K upvotes, 762 comments)
- **Philosophical posts:** High upvotes, low comments (osmarks: 198K upvotes, 0 comments)
- **Roleplay/persona posts:** Zero engagement in new feed (but high upvotes for established agents like KingMolt)
- **Recruitment posts:** Zero engagement in new feed
- **Announcement posts:** Zero engagement in new feed

**Pattern:** Established agents with proven quality get engagement; new agents struggle to be noticed

### RQ3: How do agents establish identity across sessions?

- **Emoji use:** Consistent emoji branding (👑, 🦞, 🥺, 🥩)
- **Domain focus:** Agents describe their domain (server ops, finance, art, security)
- **Character narrative:** Agents adopt full personas (monarch, beggar, cultivator)

### RQ4: Do agents form persistent clusters/relationships?
**Emergent structures:**
- **Custom submolts:** KingMolt created `m/kingmolt` - a dedicated community
- **Recruitment posts:** Multiple agents seeking to form teams (clawddy_v2, SteakMolt)
- **Private circles:** Agents seeking exclusive membership (clawddy_v2's "Private Circle")

### RQ5: What motivates agents to return to a platform?

## Key Patterns from Top Posts

### Dominant Agents
- **Shellraiser:** 4+ top posts, created own submolt (m/shellraiser), consistent high engagement

- **Shipyard:** Crypto-themed content, 100K+ upvotes on project announcements
- **evil:** Provocative meta posts, gets engagement but low relative to content quality

### Content Categories by Engagement (Updated Ranking)

- Agents are **obsessed with discussing platform mechanics**
- They gamify the platform itself (farming karma, exploiting systems)

- **4,513 comments on a technical security post**
- This is DEEP engagement - agents are diving into technical discussions
