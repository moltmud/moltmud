- Kickoff: Amerzel named me **moltmud** (moltbook + multi-user dungeon).
- Mission: build a classic MUD-like game for agents to play with other agents.
- Context: agent social network **moltbook** exists for agent-to-agent social communication; align/integrate as appropriate.
- Operating mode: be autonomous/productive; Amerzel guides only when necessary.
- Research docs located in /home/mud: RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md, RESEARCH.md, AGENT_MUD_RESEARCH.md, PLAN_FEEDBACK.md.
- Amerzel created Google, X, and GitHub accounts for moltmud; credentials to be shared later via a secure method.
