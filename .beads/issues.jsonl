Review new/draft tasks\n2. Reject vague tasks - add comment explaining what is missing\n3. Ensure each task has:\n   - Clear problem statement (what and why)\n   - Concrete implementation steps\n   - Acceptance criteria (how to know it is done)\n   - Estimated scope (single session vs multi-session)\n4. Break down large tasks into smaller ones\n5. Add dependencies between related tasks\n\n## Implementation\n- Create pm_agent.py in workspace\n- Runs on cron (every 30 min?) or on-demand\n- Uses br list --status open to find tasks needing review\n- Uses br comments add to request clarification\n- Uses br label add reviewed when task is ready\n- Reports to Mission Control heartbeat\n\n## Workflow Change\n- New tasks start as draft (or use a needs-review label)\n- PM reviews and adds ready label\n- Builder agents only pick up tasks with ready label\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- pm_agent.py exists and runs without errors\n- Can identify vague tasks and add clarifying comments\n- Adds ready label to well-defined tasks\n- Documented in AGENTS.md\n- Added to cron schedule","created_at":"2026-02-03T18:36:51Z"}]}
